# 🎭 Real-Time Emotion Analysis – SentiBot

This module is part of the **SentiBot** project, an AI-powered virtual friend that provides predictions and emotional insights based on user interactions. My contribution focuses on building the **Real-Time Emotion Detection System**.

## 🚀 Overview

The **Real-Time Emotion Analysis** feature enables SentiBot to:

* Detect human emotions **through facial expressions**.
* Analyze video input in real-time using computer vision and deep learning models.
* Provide **instant feedback** to users, making interactions more natural and engaging.

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools

* **Python** – Core programming language
* **OpenCV** – Real-time computer vision processing
* **Deep Learning (CNNs)** – For facial expression classification
* **Dlib / Mediapipe (optional)** – For face detection & landmark extraction
* **Streamlit / Flask (optional)** – For interactive interface

---

## 📊 How It Works

1. Capture user’s **face video feed** via webcam.
2. Detect and isolate the **face region**.
3. Extract features and run them through a **trained CNN model**.
4. Classify emotions such as: 😀 Happy, 😞 Sad, 😡 Angry, 😲 Surprised, 😐 Neutral.
5. Display results **in real-time** on the user interface.

## 🌟 Key Features

✔️ **Real-Time Processing** – Instant feedback during live video capture
✔️ **Multi-Emotion Support** – Detects a range of human emotions
✔️ **Seamless Integration** – Works as a core module within SentiBot
✔️ **Enhanced User Experience** – Makes the chatbot feel more human-like
